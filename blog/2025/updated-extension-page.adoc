The Keycloak homepage has an updated community extensions page!
Thanks to https://github.com/mabartos[Martin Barto≈°], each extension shows off with its GitHub stars.

This should provide you with a better overview which extensions are popular with the community.

If an extension you use is listed there, give a star!
Are you missing an extension? https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-web/issues[Create an issue in our GitHub issue tracker] to let us know so we can add it.

PS: Did you already give Keycloak a star?
